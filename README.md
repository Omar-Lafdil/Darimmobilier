#### The Web app we created contains a page in which you can predict/estimate the price of a flat depending on its features (surface, city etc...) using a Random Forest Model.

#### The Web App contains also a Dashboard that represents the most important metrics and changes of the moroccan real estate market. This Dashboard provides 3 different aspects of analysis.
